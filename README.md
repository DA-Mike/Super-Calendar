# Super Calendar

This was a great project to learn more about third-party APIs. This project utilizes HTML, Javascript, jQuery, moment.js, and Bootstrap.

The assignment was to create a responsive daily calendar where the user can input tasks and save those tasks for the day. The tasks persist as they are saved to local storage and will remain on the calendar unless removed.
